# File-Encryption-Decryption-Tool
The tool reads from a file, encrypts or decrypts the contents using the Caesar Cipher, and saves the result to a new file.

How to Run:
1. Create a text file with some content that you want to encrypt (e.g., input.txt).
2. Run the script from the command line:
python file_encryption_tool.py

3. Follow the prompts:
Enter the name of the input file (e.g., input.txt).
Enter the name of the output file where the result will be saved (e.g., encrypted.txt).
Enter the shift value (e.g., 3 for a shift of 3).
